The persistence of "www" in URLs is more inertia than necessity. As browsers evolve, the need for "www" fades - yet many sites still redirect from apex domains to "www" out of habit, not logic. ðŸ‘‡  
  
Back in 2013, I argued that the "www" subdomain was a relic. Browsers defaulted to HTTP, and users were already typing "<example.com>" - not "<www.example.com>". My thesis: making "www" mandatory added needless friction for users.  
  
The history makes sense: early sites needed to distinguish web, mail, and FTP services. But now, most route apex domains directly. The supposed benefits - like content negotiation - rarely matter for average sites.  
  
What happened? Users adapted faster than infrastructure. Some legacy setups need "www" (for cookies or load balancing), but for most, it's pointless. Modern browsers even hide the scheme and subdomain, showing just the core domain.  
  
With HSTS, CNAME flattening, and managed DNS, reasons to keep "www" are minimal in 2025\. But inertia lingers. Why do some organizations still insist? What complexity am I missing? Check the original essay for context: <https://anandchowdhary.com/blog/2013/the-death-of-www>
