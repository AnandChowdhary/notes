The SAFE for Series A is here:  
  
[@Standard\_Cap](https://x.com/Standard%5FCap)'s Series A pack with a term sheet, stock purchase agreement, investors' rights, an A&R certificate of incorporation, and a side letter.  
  
Clean and practical, a good baseline to kick off a round.  
  
What I like most is the format. It's just .docx in Git (yes, Word - I'm sure will be markdown shorly). Fork, version, diff, and review in PRs.  
  
If you're raising, ask your investors that you want to use the Standard Series A paperwork: <https://github.com/StandardCap/standard-series-a>
