This week at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant) we shipped HubSpot deal sync (feature preview). Automatic two way updates so your pipeline stays in step. Week 36, Sep 1 to 7, 2025\. ðŸ”„ðŸ‘‡  
  
What it does: sync deals from FirstQuadrant to HubSpot and back. Titles, amounts, stages, and owners update quietly in the background. Pipelines stay in lockstep too. From connection settings you can sync pipelines so HubSpot matches your FirstQuadrant setup. Deletes are mirrored both ways.  
  
Improvements: new connection options to sync pipelines and run a one time pipeline sync to align with your CRM. Deal pages got clearer actions and UI so starting a HubSpot sync takes a click or two. Fixes: the note actions menu only shows when relevant for imported notes, and avatars render correctly for notes from Zapier or app integrations.  
  
Under the hood: full deal events for create, update, delete. Connection activity logs in the schema and UI for traceability. Pipeline sync is configurable via syncPipelinesEnabled. Better handling of HubSpot pipeline limits. New ConnectionMapItem for connection specific mappings. Cleaner routes and event handling. Auto generated docs and changelog updates.  
  
Bottom line: your FirstQuadrant and HubSpot deals and pipelines stay consistent with less manual work. This is a feature preview. Full notes: <https://docs.firstquadrant.ai/changelog/2025-09-07-hub-spot-deal-sync>
