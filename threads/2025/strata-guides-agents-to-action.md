Been deep in MCP land these days. Klavis AI (YC X25) clicked for me. It helps agents use thousands of tools reliably (yes, really). The standout for me is Strata, a unified MCP router that gets past that 40-50 tool wall I've run into and guides agents from intent to action.  
  
Strata runs as one MCP server in front of many apps. The agent starts broad, then Strata narrows down step by step to the right tool and parameters. Less tool bloat. More tasks finished.  
  
Beyond Strata, there are 50+ production MCP servers with real OAuth and Docker images. GitHub, Gmail, Slack, Salesforce, and friends. Self host or go managed, and skip the glue code per vendor.  
  
I like the choices: MCP first design, Python, MIT license. Clear path to reliable cross app agents. If you're building agentic apps or copilots, worth a look. Repo: <https://github.com/Klavis-AI/klavis>
