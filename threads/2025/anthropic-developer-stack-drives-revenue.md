The $13B helps but it is coding PMF + distribution that turned model gains into revenue. [@AnthropicAI](https://x.com/AnthropicAI)'s wedge is a developer stack, not a chatbot. Claude Code, IDE integrations like Copilot, and MCP convert upgrades into billable time.  
  
Opus 4.1 pushes coding SOTA at 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified. Hybrid reasoning, 200k context, and agent style multi file edits now run through [@ClaudeAI](https://x.com/ClaudeAI) Code and the usual channels like API, Bedrock, Vertex, and Copilot - I'm just waiting for the full-stack agent I can assign GitHub and Linear issues to.  
  
Pricing lands near $15/million input tokens and $75/million output tokens. Prompt caching and batch jobs can cut costs by up to 90% and 50%. That is a direct nod to inference unit economics.  
  
Model + agent tooling plus protocol + distribution explains the more than 10x growth in Claude Code and the enterprise pull.  
  
Boring pipes that scale. I like that.  
  
What feels new is the GTM. Aim at coding where ROI is auditable, then syndicate with GitHub, AWS, GCP, and Databricks. Model deltas are incremental, but they compound once agents can edit large repos reliably.  
  
Tradeoff is that inference heavy work squeezes margin. Recent reporting points to gross margin around 50-60% versus about 77% for "typical" SaaS (which is surprisingly low considering their $0 inference cost in hindsight). Channel concentration risk is real if Copilot and Cursor carry most of the load.  
  
From a founder view, the tech checks out on coding evals. The business still rides cost curves and channel stability. I have the scars on both.  
  
Why raise $13B @ $183B now? Two reasons I see: Capacity and credibility.  
  
Capacity is obvious. Training and inference demand is exploding. Anthropic estimates US AI power needs at least 50 gigawatts by 2028\. Cash secures GPUs, power, and a global footprint.  
  
Credibility shows up in the numbers. More than 300k business customers. Accounts over $100k up roughly 7x YoY. Run rate above $5B w/ Claude Code @ \~$500M. That derisks sales even if the forward multiple is spicy.  
  
Three things I am watching:  
1) Do margins hold as usage shifts to longer thinking traces and agent loops even with caching?  
2) How concentrated is revenue by channel, and how quickly can direct enterprise take share?  
3) Do SWE-bench gains translate to sustained pass at 1 in real repo refactors inside Copilot and Cursor at scale  
  
Next year is the test. If coding PMF + distribution holds while costs drift down, a 20-37x revenue setup can harden into durable economics. Cautiously optimistic. Shipping and learning either way.
