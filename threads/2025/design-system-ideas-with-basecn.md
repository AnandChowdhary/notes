Been poking at design system ideas again, and basecn caught my eye: shadcn/ui vibes on top of [@base\_ui](https://x.com/base%5Fui) primitives. TypeScript-first, accessible, extra variants, and lots of copy‑pasteable examples.  
  
What I like: Base UI under the hood gives you WAI‑ARIA, predictable focus, and solid performance. The multiple demos per component help you pick a pattern fast, so you ship instead of bikeshed. No more fighting focus rings at 2 am. [@akash\_3444](https://x.com/akash%5F3444) really cooked!  
  
Stack check: React + TypeScript, Tailwind for styling, Base UI for primitives. Clean APIs and straightforward theming. I could drop this into a team rolling a design system next week.  
  
Building a library or a product? You get polished components, rich examples, and room to customize while leaning on MUI a11y: <https://github.com/akash3444/basecn>
