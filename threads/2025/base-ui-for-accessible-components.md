Been playing with Base UI from the MUI folks: Unstyled, accessibility-first React bits from the people behind Radix, Floating UI, and Material UI. I like that I can plug in my tokens and not fight default styles.  
  
What hooked me is the WAI-ARIA focused primitives. I bring Tailwind or CSS in JS, and Base UI handles behavior, keyboard support, and the accessibility semantics (yes, please). The TypeScript types make it hard to wire things wrong.  
  
The team is a fun mashup: Radix a11y rigor, Floating UI positioning smarts, and MUI component craft. I get headless building blocks to compose buttons, menus, comboboxes, dialogs. No theme lock in.  
  
I would be surprised if this doesn't become the default over Radix on [@shadcn](https://x.com/shadcn) UI once it reaches 1.0.  
  
If you are shipping a product or a design system, this gives you a consistent behavior layer, sensible a11y defaults, and a clean React API. TypeScript, MIT license, and solid docs.
