Anthropic buying Bun is like a third order consequence that I couldn’t have predicted when Bun was founded. Anthropic is quietly buying the bottom of the stack for AI dev tools. If your coding agent compiles to a runtime you own, you own: - Latency knobs - Stability guarantees - DX ergonomics That is very different from Copilot or Cursor, which still have to play nice with generic runtimes. This is “vertical integration of the agent loop” in practice. If AI agents are the new IDE, Bun is Anthropic buying the kernel.
