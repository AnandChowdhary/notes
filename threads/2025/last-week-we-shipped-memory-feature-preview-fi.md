Last week we shipped Memory (feature preview) - FirstQuadrant can now remember context from your sales conversations and reuse it to make every email, intro, and follow‑up more personal and consistent. I'm really excited about this one. 👇 Enable it via Settings → Feature preview. Once on, the AI builds a durable memory of your interactions (yes, really!) and applies it across touchpoints - so you don't repeat yourself, and prospects feel known. Tools like ChatGPT have had it for a while and it’s great. Other improvements to speed setup and collaboration: - Copy‑to‑clipboard for webhook URLs in import settings - Auto email when new teammates are invited - Deal tooltip lists all contacts when >4 - Billing: quick button to your Stripe subscription dashboard - Trial popup: loading state + clearer messaging - Terminology: "membership" → "team member", "Archived" → "Inactive", "Subscription" → "Subscription status" - Action bar: "reject" replaces "delete", overlays play nicer on small screens Fixes that reduce noise and clarify status: - No follow‑up tasks if a meeting is already on the calendar - Removed "Consumer webhooks" + "Deleted contacts" from settings - Corrected completed task display when credits were 0 - Approve/unapprove now handled correctly in the action bar Behind the scenes for reliability: - Memory infra wired through org schema + DB - New dev routes/event types for Inngest testing - Stripe API 2025‑06‑30.basil (pkg 18.3.0) - Email processing includes recent contact activity, future activity retrieval improved - Automatic invite emails with personalized onboarding - Updated prompts for better autocomplete - Frontmatter added to feature preview docs - New queue events for contact enrichment - Follow‑up reasoning now checks future calendar events first Bottom line: Memory preview keeps your conversations personal and consistent - backed by clearer labels, faster setup, and targeted fixes.
