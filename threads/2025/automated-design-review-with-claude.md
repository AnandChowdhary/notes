Been deep in Claude Code for months now, so this from [@PatOakEllis](https://x.com/PatOakEllis) hit home: Practical workflows from an AI-native startup.  
  
The Design Review workflow is kinda cool: Automated feedback on frontend PRs for UI and UX consistency and accessibility before merge. Less guesswork, more signal.  
  
Under the hood, it drives a real browser with Playwright MCP and pairs it with Claude Code agents. It looks at the rendered UI, checks against standards, and catches visual issues early.  
  
This turns design QA into a repeatable step teams can share, not a last minute ping. Handy when you are growing a design system or shipping fast.  
  
Patrick Ellis has solid tutorials and demos on YouTube. Worth a look: <https://github.com/OneRedOak/claude-code-workflows>
