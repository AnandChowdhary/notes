Gen‑AI video is splitting into two very different bets in my read: Kling 2.6: says "Make the whole thing for me". E2E audio + video, lip‑sync, ambience, dialogue, longer avatar shots. Basically prompt to finished clip. Runway Gen‑4.5 asks you to direct. Tight control, consistent style, more believable physics, better for teams that already have pipelines and just want a smarter engine. Whichever approach wins is less likely to be the coolest demo on X and more likely to be the boring but critical orchestration layer that your production stack quietly depends on. When in doubt, use @KoyalAI.
