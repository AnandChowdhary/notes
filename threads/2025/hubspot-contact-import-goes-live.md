This week at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant): HubSpot contact import is live (feature preview). Pull your CRM into FQ with a click, unify lists, and start outreach with no CSVs. Week 37, 2025\. ðŸ”ŒðŸ‘‡  
  
How it works:  
â€¢ Go to Imports â†’ Apps  
â€¢ Connect HubSpot  
â€¢ Start an all-contacts import  
Hit Import and watch your workspace populate with people your team already knows. We show HubSpot-specific labels and descriptions so you know what's coming in and how it'll look. Contacts are ready for Qualification, Sequences, Autopilot.  
  
Improvements  
â€¢ Deal pages now show multiple associated contacts and companies on HubSpot-synced deals for full context.  
â€¢ Import settings now include HubSpot-specific details to reduce guesswork.  
  
Fix  
â€¢ Emails no longer stall when a prior message has a future timestamp. We send using the current time.  
  
Under the hood  
â€¢ New HubSpot "all contacts" import endpoint, new response types, tighter error handling  
â€¢ Unified deal upsert, connection IDs, and schemas for multi-contact/company  
â€¢ Better error logs, a pagination guard, and correct audit/deleted-deal checks  
  
Docs  
â€¢ Revamped HubSpot guides: BCC auto-logging, pipeline sync, deal sync  
â€¢ Email/Calendar docs: what the "Invalid" OAuth badge means + Nylas reauth steps  
â€¢ Auto-generated docs/changelog to keep notes current
