I stumbled on Ripple by [@trueadm](https://x.com/trueadm) and it made me smile. A TypeScript first UI framework with its own .ripple files and a signal style reactive core. Feels like React, Solid, and Svelte had coffee and decided to ship fine grained updates together.  
  
What I like so far: track and @ for reactivity. JSX like templating with a simple component model. Very fine grained rendering. Full TypeScript. VS Code diagnostics, IntelliSense, and Prettier support.  
  
It is very early. SPA only for now. Built in under a week (yes, really). The pedigree is wild: Inferno, React Hooks, Lexical, Svelte 5\. It even aims to be LLM friendly in the language design. That combo makes it a fun experiment to follow.  
  
Why I am poking at it: clean mental model, good editor tooling, and a Vite starter so you can try it in minutes. The package name on npm is ripple. If you are curious about next gen reactivity and ergonomics, take a look: <https://github.com/trueadm/ripple>
