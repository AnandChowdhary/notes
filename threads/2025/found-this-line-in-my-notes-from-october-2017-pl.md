Found this line in my notes from October 2017: "Places on MWLII: List co-working places." In 2025, I added a comment to decode it: I wanted a coworking listing site for founders in India. Back then it felt like a tiny side project I could hack together over a weekend 💡👇 In 2017, coworking in India was exploding. WeWork was noisy, local brands were opening new centers every month, and every founder doing the Bangalore–Delhi–Mumbai loop had the same question: "Where do I work from for a week?" The obvious solution looked like a simple directory. List spaces, add filters, done. But over time, discovery moved from static websites to networks. Answers to "Where should I work from in Koramangala?" now live in WhatsApp groups, X threads, private founder circles. What people really wanted was not a map of desks. They wanted social proof, warm intros, and trusted access. That is the trap with "just a directory" ideas. The durable value is almost always in coordination, reputation, and access layered on top of the list. If I wrote this note today, I'd probably start from the trust graph, not the spreadsheet. Here's the original note from 2017: https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/notes/blob/main/notes/2017/places-on-mwlii.md
