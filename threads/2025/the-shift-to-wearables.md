The big shift for me this year: LLMs left the browser and moved into things I wear. I use Ray‑Ban Meta glasses and a Limitless pendant every day (yes, really!). It happened fast, and it already changes how I look, listen, and decide in the moment. 🕶️👇  
  
Why now: Been using the glasses since last year and recently Meta shipped "look and ask" multimodal Meta AI on Ray‑Ban glasses to more EU countries, added live translation, and a Live AI mode over the camera stream. [@LimitlessAI](https://x.com/LimitlessAI) reframed "meeting notes" into an always‑with‑you memory pendant that is extremely useful, although [@SukritiKapoor15](https://x.com/SukritiKapoor15) doesn’t let me wear it when she’s around.  
  
Different affordances.  
\- Glasses: real time vision answers, tap to ask, audio replies in‑ear. Live translation across English, Spanish, French, Italian, with offline packs for spotty signal. Live AI that chats over the camera stream.  
\- Pendant: 24/7 voice capture with a visible recording LED, automatic phone and cloud offload, configurable retention.  
Glasses feel instant for short asks. Pendant can lag when syncing but keeps your day's context.  
  
Tradeoffs I watch closely: consent, retention, and reliability. Even fans flag miscaptures and awkward moments. Makers urge explicit consent and offer retention controls, yet laws and social norms change by place and setting. The etiquette is still forming.  
  
Open questions: What defaults should be mandatory: clear indicators, geofencing for sensitive spaces, sane retention windows? Where do glasses vs pendants each make sense in daily life and work? With [@Meta](https://x.com/Meta) Connect next month teasing AI+wearables news, this is the moment to set good norms.
