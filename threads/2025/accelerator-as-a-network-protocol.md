I keep coming back to an old scribble: an accelerator as a protocol for selection, learning, and network effects. Free, remote, 0% equity. The idea was clear. The shape wasn't. Is it one program or a partner mesh? ðŸš€ðŸ‘‡  
  
Found this in my notes from Aug 13, 2017 while cleaning the old folder: "Oswald accelerator in partnership with nobility accelerator and I focus accelerators." In 2025 I added: "YC for the next billion founders, 0% equity, selfâ€‘taught" (yes, really!). In 2017, equity and inâ€‘person cohorts ruled. Remote was fringe. Even the note was fuzzy on structure - network of partners or one wrapper?  
  
What changed by 2025 is the bundle unraveled into four Cs.  
â€¢ Curriculum went open and cohort based, with projects as the unit.  
â€¢ Community moved to alwaysâ€‘on chat and async repos. Global mentorship feels normal.  
â€¢ Credential shifted from brand to proof of work. Public code, shipping cadence, real users.  
â€¢ Capital diversified: grants, credits, prizes, preâ€‘sales, small flexible checks.  
Selection followed the same arc, from pedigree to proofâ€‘ofâ€‘work. LLMs now draft docs, review code, and sketch experiments so humans lean into judgment and intros.  
  
Zeroâ€‘equity, remote accelerators work when they modularize.  
â€¢ Selection: open calls, light screens, public artifacts over essays.  
â€¢ Learning: open curriculum, office hours, project milestones.  
â€¢ Community: peer circles, alumni compasses, rotating experts.  
â€¢ Capital: grants, credits, prizes, revâ€‘share pilots, optional checks later.  
Tradeoffs: sustainability and who funds the commons. Signaling and whether nonâ€‘equity credentials matter. Depth at scale. The enduring moat is network density, not content.  
  
Durable principles I'd keep: proof over pitch. Modular over monolith. Public by default. Network density beats content. Teach people to fish.  
Open questions:  
1) Can we score selection with transparent signals without recreating gatekeeping?  
2) What funding stack keeps 0% equity resilient across cycles?  
3) How do we codify mentor judgment so it scales without losing taste?
