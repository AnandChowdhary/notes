Nano-banana tops the charts, sure - but the bigger deal is [@Google](https://x.com/Google) folding image gen and editing into the same flow with token metering, a conversational loop, and scripts. Architecture over Elo. That is the story for builders.  
  
Under the hood: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image Preview (aka nano-banana) is a native image gen and edit model that mixes multi image fusion, targeted natural language edits, and very stable character identity.  
  
Shipping surface: [@GeminiApp](https://x.com/GeminiApp), API, AI Studio, Vertex. SynthID on by default. Pricing is token based: $30 per 1M output tokens. A 1024x1024 image is about 1,290 output tokens, roughly $0.039 per image.  
  
üçå Yes, banana math. üçå  
  
Google even name checks the codename. Before release it collected over 5M arena votes, about 2.5M on this model, with a record 171 Elo lead over the runner up.  
  
What is novel vs incremental? To me this looks like an LMM first image stack. Edits lean on the language backbone for world knowledge. Reference aware conditioning keeps identity. You can compose across multiple images. All wired for low latency UX and a single bill.  
  
Reality check: Arena Elo is preference based and sensitive to the prompt mix. Per prompt results can diverge from the global board. Google also lists open issues like small faces, fine detail, and spelling. So the margin is interesting, but I am treating it as a moving target, not a settled SOTA.  
  
Why it matters for founders: Images stop being a separate tool and become just another modality inside the LMM. Token priced outputs let you chain edits, route alongside text tools, and drop this into programmatic workflows.  
  
Synth watermarking by default lines up with provenance norms. The launch playbook is savvy too. Validate demand in public evals, tune, then light it up across app, API, and routers in one go.  
  
I expect the next race to focus on identity preservation and controllable natural language edits, more than chasing photorealistic text to image.  
  
The architecture shift is the headline for me, and it will shape how we design products this quarter. And I'm glad I can use the banana emoji unironically! üçåüçåüçå
