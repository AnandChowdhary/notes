This week at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant): HubSpot BCC email logging is live. I've wanted this one for a while. Connect HubSpot and we autoâ€‘BCC outgoing emails from connected mailboxes so every convo lands in your CRM and deal timelines stay tidy. Week 35, 2025\. ðŸ“§ðŸ‘‡  
  
How it works: Connect HubSpot, toggle BCC logging. We add HubSpot's BCC on the fly to emails you send from connected mailboxes. HubSpot then attaches them to the right contacts and companies. No forwarding, no copyâ€‘paste (yes, really). Your team keeps full context.  
  
Improvements:  
\- New emails process instantly, so timelines and suggestions refresh faster.  
\- Smoother firstâ€‘sync: recent emails and events load quicker and in the right order.  
\- "Nothing review" â†’ "No action taken," with clearer activity text.  
\- Import settings explain how AI reasoning is used.  
  
Fixes:  
\- Actions from an activity hit the correct contact.  
\- Email addresses are normalized to avoid dupes.  
  
Reliability:  
\- Stronger HubSpot connection with BCC support  
\- Safer retries on org clearing + global concurrency defaults  
\- Immediate postâ€‘upsert email processing with rateâ€‘limit backoff  
\- Nango + core deps updates, secure integration key  
\- Usage flag for AI credit tracking, autoâ€‘updated docs  
  
Bottom line: HubSpot stays up to date on its own, so timelines are accurate and engagement history is complete. To try it, connect HubSpot in settings and enable BCC logging. Full notes and setup steps: <https://docs.firstquadrant.ai/changelog/2025-08-31-hub-spot-bcc-email-logging>
