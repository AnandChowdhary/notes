This week at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant) (Week 39, 2025), we shipped cleaner suggestions. We now ignore emails parked in warm-up/warming folders so automation pays attention to real conversations. Small change, big quality-of-life win. ‚úâÔ∏èüëá  
  
What changed: suggestions skip any message that lives in warm-up or warming labels across connected mailboxes. Those training pings (yes, those "warming" labels) don't show up in "what to do next," so your next steps reflect actual outreach.  
  
Impact: a calmer activity feed and a smarter Autopilot. Fewer false positives, less manual triage, and faster focus on genuine prospects. You see the important stuff sooner.  
  
Under the hood, we updated the suggestion engine to detect and bypass known warm-up folders across mailboxes, cutting false positives and wasted processing. Net result: a tighter queue and quicker follow ups. Full changelog: <https://docs.firstquadrant.ai/changelog/2025-09-28-cleaner-suggestions>
