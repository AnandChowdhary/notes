MCP + AGENTS\\.md are now sitting under Linux Foundation governance and, together, they are starting to look a lot like "TCP/IP + POSIX for LLMs". If this coalition holds, a few big things could happen: - IDEs, CLIs, and internal platforms might all plug into the same agent substrate instead of every vendor inventing Yet Another Integration Layer. - "Bring your own model, bring your own infra" becomes more realistic, because the contract between agent ↔ tools/data is stable. - Enterprise stacks get less about wiring and orchestration glue and more about actual logic and UX. Less yak-shaving, more shipping. The boring governance detail is actually the punchline. Linux Foundation stewardship makes it much harder for any single vendor to hijack the standard, and much easier for infra, devtool, and SaaS players to align on one protocol instead of ten incompatible ones.
