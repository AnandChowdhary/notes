I got early access to GPT‑5.2‑Codex. It's incredible - @OpenAI is shipping an LLM + tools stack that can think at repo scale without forgetting what it decided 20 files ago. 1\. Long‑horizon planning: With context compaction and all the SWE‑Bench Pro / Terminal‑Bench 2.0 state‑of‑the‑art flexing, it can actually hold and execute a multi‑step plan across a real codebase. Not "fix this function," more "refactor this service and wire everything back up." 2\. Tool‑centric workflow: It is clearly designed to live inside your dev tooling and CI, not just a chat box. Think LLM as the brains on top of your repo, shell, tests, and deployment pipeline. 3\. Governance as product surface: The high‑end cyber / dual‑use bits are being wrapped in trusted‑access and policy. That means frontier coding is doubling as a governance sandbox. The "real" model is gated, and access is an API product plus a compliance conversation. OpenAI is testing what happens when you give a machine a whole codebase, a toolbox, and some guardrails, then ask it to ship.
