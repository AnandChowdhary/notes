This week’s “agent tooling vs safety” news feels like watching the same architecture independently emerge from 3 different codebases. LangSmith, LlamaAgents, and HF Skills are all drifting toward declarative, composable agent specs. At the same time, BrowseSafe quietly shows that narrow, domain-specific safety fine-tunes can beat big generic classifiers. Put together, it’s a pretty strong hint for founders: secure, tool-using agents probably won’t be “one giant god model with vibes,” but vertically specialized stacks with clear contracts, typed tools, and domain-tuned safety wrapped around them. Less magic, more systems design. Which is honestly where the fun is.
