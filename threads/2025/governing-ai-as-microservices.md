Org-wide Skills + a central directory basically turn Claude into a governed microservice mesh. Each Skill is now a versioned, permissioned API surface over your tools and data. So governance moves up a layer. It stops being "did we engineer the perfect prompt?" and starts being "who can call which Skills, from where, and with what guarantees?". That is a much nicer problem. So you can treat AI like another internal platform. You design Skills like microservices. You ship and version them. You gate them with policy.
