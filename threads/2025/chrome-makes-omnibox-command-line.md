Chrome just turned the omnibox into a command line for the web. AI Mode blends search, page context, and actions. Gemini 2.5 does cross‚Äëtab summaries today, agents next. Extensions now compete with the browser they live in. üåêüëá  
  
On device, Nano watches for scams and offers one click password resets. Client side means lower latency and fewer data trips. Good for security and trust.  
  
Founders should note the shift in control. If the browser owns privileged actions like resets and form fill, many security and helper extensions lose their best hooks. Your value has to move up a layer to workflow and policy.  
  
Edge and Copilot now compete with the browser itself. Same for extension devs. The default UI is the omnibox conversation, so placement moves from toolbar icons to intents.  
  
I expect new APIs for safe agency. Think explicit intents, per site grants, tool caps, and clear audit logs. Ship small tools the browser can call, then stitch them into a narrow, measurable workflow. Speed and reliability will win.  
  
As builders, do we target the browser's tool API or keep shipping full extensions? How do we price when the baseline summary is free and fast? What proves value when the omnibox answers first?  
  
My take: design for coexecution with the browser, own a thin slice end to end, measure time saved, and play nice with the new agent. I'm excited. This changes how we build productivity UX.
