Week 34 at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant): Event imports are live. Pipe external events from your tools into contact timelines, and we'll reason on them to set context and followâ€‘ups. Each is tagged "external event," so you can see what happened and why a task exists. ðŸ”ŒðŸ‘‡  
  
How to use it: Imports â†’ Apps â†’ connect â†’ choose Events. We'll ingest event payloads (not just notes), label them, and trigger the right actions - no copyâ€‘paste. You get instant context and timely followâ€‘ups as things happen across your stack.  
  
Improvements:  
\- Allâ€‘email open tracking  
\- Smarter sequences + clearer reasoning  
\- Merge duplicate "Answer question" tasks  
\- No calendar task if all externals decline  
\- Context panel loading state for team enrichment  
\- Workspaceâ€‘scoped saved filters with autoâ€‘clear  
  
Fixes:  
\- Campaign sequences charge 1 credit  
\- Archived contacts with pending autoâ€‘archive no longer show in activity  
\- Saved filters persist correctly per org  
  
Under the hood:  
\- Eventâ€‘driven action sync + scheduled jobs  
\- Faster contact summaries after reasoning  
\- More reliable imports with logs and stricter schemas  
\- A/B testing for action determination  
  
Bottom line: more context from your tools, less noise, clearer reasoning, sturdier automation. What app are you connecting first?
