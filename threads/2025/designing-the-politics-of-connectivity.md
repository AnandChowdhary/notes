In 2013 I worked on a project to redesign I<nternet.org> and I learned a bigger truth - design for "connect the world" is never neutral. Visual systems can signal openness, agency, and power. Pixels were easy, but purpose was hard. üåçüëá  
  
Logo choices: Reduce the globe to a circle. Set "internet" in Helvetica lowercase. Put "org" inside a negative circle to highlight the nonprofit. Tomato orange for energy. Inspired by Jabong's dot trick. Good mnemonic, but can confuse across scripts and locales.  
  
The site: A looping banner of faces from Greg Peverill-Conti to feel connected. I moved background-position with setInterval about every 100 ms. Header and nav filled the first screen via <window.inner>Height. My own grid, Source Sans Pro, and simple scroll fade ins.  
  
With 2025 eyes, I'd switch to CSS keyframes or rAF with transforms and respect prefers-reduced-motion. Use IntersectionObserver for scroll. Layout with Grid/Subgrid and container queries. Fonts via system stacks or variable fonts. Also budget for Web Vitals, energy on low end Android, semantics, and keyboard focus.  
  
Reality check. I<nternet.org> became Free Basics and hit net neutrality headwinds in India, while Facebook turned into Meta. If a brand promises openness, it needs governance, consent, and aligned incentives, or it reads like veneer.
