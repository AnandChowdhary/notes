Sora 2 buffs world sim and ships native A/V. Bigger move is product: consented cameos + C2PA + a steerable recommender in an inviteâ€‘only iOS app. That's a closedâ€‘loop data/RL flywheel for video agents. Veo 3 is strong, but platform wins. ðŸŽ¥ðŸ‘‡  
  
World sim that keeps continuity across shots means fewer jumpy frames and more believable physics. You can storyboard without praying the coffee cup stays on the table.  
  
Native audio and video IO lets you capture, edit, and render in one stack. Lower latency, aligned sound, fewer glue scripts. Less duct tape, more flow.  
  
Consentâ€‘gated cameos are basically an identity API for media. You get clear rights signals on who can appear, where, and how. That tightens safety and lets you fineâ€‘tune on approved likenesses without waking up to a takedown.  
  
C2PA on top gives verifiable provenance. Editors and platforms can trust or throttle automatically. Cleaner labels over time lead to cleaner gradients.  
  
A steerable recommender inside the app closes the loop. Users react, skip, and tweak prompts. Those signals train reward models and policy. You can run fast A/Bs, do bandit exploration, and nudge outputs toward what people actually watch.  
  
Inviteâ€‘only buys time to tune norms and rate limits. Private data stays in house, which makes RL on engagement and retention a lot less noisy.  
  
Veo 3 still looks great on raw quality, and you can ship a demo on that. The moat lives in distribution and tooling. The team with capture â†’ generate â†’ edit â†’ publish in one place will learn faster and ship features APIâ€‘only shops can't match.  
  
For devs, watch for SDKs, batch inference, and controls beyond prompts: motion, blocking, lighting, and audio stems. If those land, we get pipelines, not weekend toys.  
  
Questions I'm asking: Does an identity rights layer become table stakes for genâ€‘video? Do platforms adopt C2PA at upload by default?  
  
My take: the model gap narrows, the product gap widens. I'm building for the latter.
