I got early access to GPT‑5.1-Codex-Max. It's basically "here’s an engineer that doesn’t get tired for 6 hours". Compared to DeepSeek V3.2, Mistral Large 3, Qwen FP8‑RL, and HF Skills which are turning high‑end coding + tools into something you can swap in and out like NPM packages. The interesting bit for us as founders: the power is drifting away from whoever owns the biggest model weights and toward whoever owns the orchestration layer, workflows, and infra glue. In other words, the moat is looking less like "we fine‑tuned a beast" and more like "we own the compiler for autonomous dev teams".
