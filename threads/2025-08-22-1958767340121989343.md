This week at [@FirstQuadrant](https://x.com/FirstQuadrant), we shipped a [@calcom](https://x.com/calcom) integration: Connect it once and every new booking becomes a qualified inbound lead with event details, organizer info, and attendee responses. Contacts are created or updated instantly, so you can follow up right away. ðŸ“…ðŸ‘‡  
  
Setup takes a minute: open Imports â†’ Apps, add C<alâ€‹.com>, copy the Subscriber URL we show, then paste it into your C<alâ€‹.com> workflow. I also refreshed the in app walkthrough and docs, so it is hard to get wrong.  
  
Workflow and clarity upgrades:  
â€¢ Filter actions and contact activity by date and time with new range pickers, plus columns for completed and snoozed dates  
â€¢ Contact pages now show when conversation history is syncing  
â€¢ Add a company to a contact from the context panel with fast search and instant feedback  
â€¢ Cleaner timelines and dropdowns with duplicates filtered out  
â€¢ Draft composer shows inline validation errors and saves reliably  
â€¢ Clearer labels across the app: "Run AI reasoning" instead of "Process", "Done" instead of "Completed", and consistent archive wording  
â€¢ Activity entries include public reasoning logs for context  
â€¢ Imports show a more accurate "potential rows" estimate and setup copy says "Subscriber URL"  
â€¢ Inactive contacts auto archive and open steps complete, suggestions ignore warming emails  
â€¢ Simpler action counts and filters, and qualified rows in imports can auto create campaign sequences  
  
Fixes and reliability:  
â€¢ Magic link login now ignores email case, and membership updates do not create duplicates  
â€¢ First email in a sequence no longer threads under old conversations  
â€¢ Draft and follow up scheduling uses your sending schedule time zone  
â€¢ Email dropdowns and activity lists no longer show duplicates  
â€¢ Cancellation banner shows the correct data deletion date, including today and 7 days after your billing period ends  
â€¢ Campaign creation correctly ignores suggestion only rows  
  
Behind the scenes:  
â€¢ Strict validation for import webhooks and a solid C<alâ€‹.com> event schema in the import router  
â€¢ Syncing and processing timestamps on contacts, plus public activity logs wired through the API and UI  
â€¢ Better email parsing when LLMs return body tags, and normalized emails across auth and membership with clearer audit logs  
â€¢ Default comparison model is now gptâ€‘4.1, removed deprecated models  
â€¢ Improved name guessing with a new LLM response schema and Hunter API enrichment  
â€¢ Stronger idempotency for file imports, refined scheduling that prioritizes your sending schedule time zone, and plenty of code and docs cleanup  
  
Week 33 in a sentence: connect C<alâ€‹.com> once and booked meetings become qualified, actionable leads in FirstQuadrant. No CSVs. No juggling tools. Configure it under Imports â†’ Apps with updated in app guidance.
