Leaflet is awesome: a tiny JS library for mobile‑friendly interactive maps that still does the big stuff. \~42 KB gzipped JS + 4 KB CSS (yes, really) and an API that gets you from tiles to markers in minutes. My kind of DX.  
  
Features I like: tile layers, markers and popups, GeoJSON vectors, controls, and a clean event model. It renders vectors with SVG and uses CSS transforms for smooth pan and zoom, so it stays snappy on mobile without pulling in WebGL. Your users' batteries will thank you.  
  
What stands out for me: the plugin ecosystem with clustering, heatmaps, drawing, routing, and clear docs. If you want components, the community wrappers for React, Vue, and Svelte are solid. Works with any tile server, from OSM to self hosted to commercial providers.  
  
Why I'm into it: minimal footprint, zero external runtime deps, readable source, and years of real‑world use across journalism, civic tech, and internal tools. Created by Volodymyr Agafonkin in Kyiv and supported by a thoughtful community. Repo: <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet>
