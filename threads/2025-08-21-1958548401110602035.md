Sharing a neat Swift SDK for [@ClaudeAI](https://x.com/ClaudeAI) Code by my friend [@aruneshsingh99](https://x.com/aruneshsingh99): Pure Swift, type safe models, and async/await with real streaming. The fun part is two way conversations, so you can build an interactive code assistant right in Swift.  
  
Things that stood out to me: typed message and block models, AsyncSequence streaming, tool support for Read, Write, and Bash, interrupt support, permission controls, zero dependencies. Swift 6 strict concurrency, plus MCP integration.  
  
I also like the small quality of life bits: You can change settings mid conversation and the session stays alive. updatePermissionMode, updateSystemPrompt, updateAllowedTools. The client API reads well too with queryStream and receiveResponse yielding TextBlock or ToolUseBlock.  
  
I can see this powering editor plugins, macOS apps, or server side Swift agents that read and write code and run bash safely. It is SPM-friendly and uses the Claude Code CLI under the hood: <https://github.com/AruneshSingh/ClaudeCodeSwiftSDK>
