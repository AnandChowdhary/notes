I once asked 2014 me a silly question: how beautiful can an article feel with one stylesheet in \~786 bytes? I shipped <essential.css> to find out. Constraints over features. Fast by default. The idea of worked better than I expected.   
  
Architecture in miniature:  
• Style the HTML you already have: h1 to h6, p, a, img, blockquote  
• One column with a \~65ch measure and comfy line height  
• Images scale to the container  
• Simple header and footer  
• Element selectors only so overrides stay easy  
  
Tradeoffs: no theming, no RTL, no print, and a11y leaned on the author. I stood on N<ormalize.css> and friends.  
  
What held up: defaults as a service, readability over chrome, constraints focus the mind.  
What broke: third party CDN, global element styling in growing apps, no tokens for consistency.  
How I would do it in 2025 while keeping the spirit:  
• 1 to 2 KB base with CSS custom properties  
• :where() to keep specificity low and @\\layer base to compose safely  
• clamp() for fluid type and sane measure  
• prefers color scheme with strong contrast  
• Minimal reset, logical properties, and container query friendly patterns  
• Versioned file you host  
  
Lessons and questions:  
• Small defaults beat big frameworks for simple content  
• Own your assets end to end  
• Write for the reader first  
What belongs in a small base today? Where is the line between reset and system? Would you still ship a global element layer or is everything a component now?
