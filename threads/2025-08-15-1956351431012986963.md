This week, [@IshSup](https://x.com/IshSup) launched Omnara (YC S25), a mission control for AI agents. It turns Claude Code, Cursor, and Copilot from quiet background workers into teammates you can guide from your phone w/ real time updates and actionable nudges for those long running jobs. ðŸ’»ðŸ‘‡  
  
What I like most is the mobile-first control with a single dashboard. You see every step an agent takes, get pinged only when input is needed, and reply in thread. There's a Python SDK too: pip install omnara to stream events to the app and web.  
  
Use cases feel spot on: review PRs while out, triage a prod incident at 2 am, keep an eye on long data migrations, nudge refactors, or shepherd flaky test fixes. Launch jobs, approve decisions, course correct. No babysitting a terminal.  
  
Under the hood looks clean: API server, PostgreSQL, push or email or SMS, and real time sync to iOS and web. Your responses flow back to the agent. Open source under Apache 2.0.  
  
If you build or use autonomous tools, this feels like the ops layer you wanted: <https://github.com/omnara-ai/omnara>
