Just read [@al3rez](https://x.com/al3rez) on dropping task apps for one <todo.txt> for faster capture and review, and data that lasts. Append only logs fail less than multi screen task managers with flaky sync.  
  
Under the hood, this is a log structured store. Dates are segments. Tasks are records. Operations are append, annotate, delete. Writes are O(1). Reads are linear but easy to index with grep or Spotlight.  
  
The side effect is provenance. You get a work log you can diff, search, and compress when it grows too big.  
  
Tradeoffs matter. Plain text does not ship reminders or collaboration. Sync uses last writer wins, so you may see conflicted copies if you edit at the same time on two devices.  
  
A middle path is Apple Notes. You get folders, rich text, attachments, Pencil, and strong on device search. Watch for export and lock in. Turn on Advanced Data Protection for end to end encryption. Pin one Daily Log note and keep the same append only flow.  
  
The pattern here is local first and protocol over platform. Text is the protocol. Editors are clients. AI is a thin layer for templates, summaries, and indexing. It is not the foundation.  
  
If you crave a little structure, use lightweight markers like Markdown checkboxes or tags. Do a quick weekly compaction into snapshots so old days stay searchable and new days stay fast.  
  
I like this because it reduces friction and increases the chance your notes and tasks survive tool churn. Start with one file or note plus a calendar. Add only what cuts latency.
