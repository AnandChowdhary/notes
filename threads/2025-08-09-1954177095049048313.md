Last week we shipped Memory (feature preview) - FirstQuadrant can now remember context from your sales conversations and reuse it to make every email, intro, and followâ€‘up more personal and consistent. I'm really excited about this one. ðŸ‘‡  
  
Enable it via Settings â†’ Feature preview. Once on, the AI builds a durable memory of your interactions (yes, really!) and applies it across touchpoints - so you don't repeat yourself, and prospects feel known. Tools like ChatGPT have had it for a while and itâ€™s great.  
  
Other improvements to speed setup and collaboration:  
\- Copyâ€‘toâ€‘clipboard for webhook URLs in import settings  
\- Auto email when new teammates are invited  
\- Deal tooltip lists all contacts when >4  
\- Billing: quick button to your Stripe subscription dashboard  
\- Trial popup: loading state + clearer messaging  
\- Terminology: "membership" â†’ "team member", "Archived" â†’ "Inactive", "Subscription" â†’ "Subscription status"  
\- Action bar: "reject" replaces "delete", overlays play nicer on small screens  
  
Fixes that reduce noise and clarify status:  
\- No followâ€‘up tasks if a meeting is already on the calendar  
\- Removed "Consumer webhooks" + "Deleted contacts" from settings  
\- Corrected completed task display when credits were 0  
\- Approve/unapprove now handled correctly in the action bar  
  
Behind the scenes for reliability:  
\- Memory infra wired through org schema + DB  
\- New dev routes/event types for Inngest testing  
\- Stripe API <2025â€‘06â€‘30.basil> (pkg 18.3.0)  
\- Email processing includes recent contact activity, future activity retrieval improved  
\- Automatic invite emails with personalized onboarding  
\- Updated prompts for better autocomplete  
\- Frontmatter added to feature preview docs  
\- New queue events for contact enrichment  
\- Followâ€‘up reasoning now checks future calendar events first  
  
Bottom line: Memory preview keeps your conversations personal and consistent - backed by clearer labels, faster setup, and targeted fixes.
