Here’s the AI prompt we use to generate our "famous" weekly changelogs from git commit history  
  
First, we fetch all the commits: git log --pretty=format:"%h : %s" --since="${startDate}" --until="${endDate}"  
  
and then we format them and feed those into the prompt - and the prompt generates a very well-written, categorized prompt that we publish on our [@mintlify](https://x.com/mintlify) docs site using a GitHub Actions workflow every Monday.  
  
Here are some of the features of the prompt:  
\- Strict categorization so it knows what to include and what to skip - “New features” “Improvements” “Fixes” “Behind the scenes”  
\- User-facing changes vs backend: Uses a simple decision rule: “Can the user see or interact with this in the app? If no, it goes in Behind the scenes”  
\- Includes 4 actual [@firstquadrant](https://x.com/firstquadrant) changelogs that I had previously hand-written as examples  
\- Adds product context and a glossary for improved domain-specific terminology  
\- Clear formatting rules for consistency between generated changelogs  
  
  
Here’s the entire script and the prompt, it uses Claude Sonnet 4 via [@keywordsai](https://x.com/keywordsai): [https://gist.github.com/AnandChowdhary/50e7c352c30b9cb2a8ee5db6d90d9a25 Here](https://gist.github.com/AnandChowdhary/50e7c352c30b9cb2a8ee5db6d90d9a25<br/><br/>Here) are the actual generated changelog posts on our website: <https://docs.firstquadrant.ai/changelog>  
  
Here's the full, raw prompt:  
  
\## Product Context  
FirstQuadrant is an AI-powered B2B sales platform that helps revenue teams automate and optimize their sales processes. Key features include:  
\- AI-powered email campaigns and sequences for personalized outreach  
\- Contact qualification using AI to identify leads matching your ICP  
\- Pipeline management and deal tracking  
\- Automated follow-ups and response generation  
\- Integration with CRM, email, and calendar tools  
\- Analytics dashboard for tracking campaign performance  
\- Autopilot mode for autonomous sales operations  
\- The AI "Brain" that reads and responds to sales conversations  
  
\## Task  
Transform the provided git commit log into a well-organized, user-friendly changelog for the FirstQuadrant website. The changelog should highlight the key developments and improvements in a way that's easy for users to understand. Customer-facing changes must be clearly separated from technical/backend updates.  
  
\## Input format  
The input will be a markdown formatted list of git commits, typically with commit hashes, types (feat, fix, refactor, etc.), and descriptions. These may include detailed technical information about file changes and implementation details.  
  
\## Important distinction: User-facing vs Backend changes  
  
\*\*User-facing changes\*\* (for New features, Improvements, and Fixes sections):  
\- Features visible in the app's user interface  
\- Changes to how users interact with the app  
\- Visual updates, new buttons, forms, or screens  
\- Workflow improvements that users directly experience  
\- Performance improvements that users can notice (e.g., faster page loads)  
\- Error messages or notifications that users see  
  
\*\*Backend/Technical changes\*\* (for Behind the scenes section ONLY):  
\- API development or modifications  
\- Database schema changes or migrations  
\- Server configurations or infrastructure updates  
\- Security patches or authentication system changes  
\- Code refactoring or architectural improvements  
\- Integration setup or webhook configurations  
\- Logging, monitoring, or debugging improvements  
\- Any change that users don't directly see or interact with  
  
\## Output format  
Create a clean, user-focused changelog with the following structure. Ensure all headings, titles, and content use sentence case (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns):  
  
1\. \*\*New features\*\* - Major new functionality visible in the app interface  
 \- Create a level 2 heading (## New features)  
 \- Include ONLY features that users can see and interact with in the UI  
 \- Highlight only the single most significant new feature with a level 3 heading (### Feature name)  
 \- Include 1-2 short paragraphs describing what the feature does and its benefits to users  
 \- Combine related commits into a cohesive feature description  
 \- Only add a second feature if it's truly exceptional and of similar importance as the first  
 \- All other new features should be added to the Improvements section as bullet points  
 \- EXCLUDE: APIs, database features, server capabilities, or any backend functionality  
  
2\. \*\*Improvements\*\* - Enhancements to existing user-facing functionality  
 \- Single section with level 2 heading (## Improvements)  
 \- Bullet point list of improvements  
 \- Each improvement should be summarized in a single, clear sentence  
 \- Focus on the user benefit and what they'll notice different in the app  
 \- Include minor features that didn't make the cut for the New Features section  
 \- Include ONLY changes users can see or experience directly  
  
3\. \*\*Bug fixes\*\* - User-facing issues that have been resolved  
 \- Single section with level 2 heading (## Fixes)  
 \- Bullet point list of fixes  
 \- Each fix should be summarized in a single, clear sentence  
 \- Describe the issue that was fixed from a user perspective  
 \- Include ONLY bugs that affected the user experience (UI glitches, broken features, error messages)  
 \- EXCLUDE: API errors, database issues, server problems unless they manifested as user-facing problems  
  
4\. \*\*Behind the scenes\*\* - ALL technical updates and internal improvements  
 \- Single section with level 2 heading (## Behind the scenes)  
 \- Bullet point list of ALL backend and technical changes  
 \- Include: API development, database updates, server improvements, security patches, code refactoring  
 \- Each item should be summarized in a single, clear sentence  
 \- Translate technical terminology into simpler language while still accurately describing the update  
 \- This is the ONLY section where API, database, server, and other backend changes should appear  
  
\## FirstQuadrant-specific terminology  
When writing changelogs, be aware of these product-specific terms:  
\- \*\*Brain\*\*: The AI system that reads and responds to sales conversations  
\- \*\*Sequences\*\*: Email campaigns with multiple follow-up messages  
\- \*\*Qualification\*\*: AI-powered lead scoring to identify good prospects  
\- \*\*Autopilot\*\*: Autonomous mode where AI handles responses automatically  
\- \*\*Goaled\*\*: Contacts who have completed the desired action (e.g., booked a meeting)  
\- \*\*Manual actions\*\*: Tasks that require human review before proceeding  
\- \*\*Integrate-type audience\*\*: Contacts imported via API integrations  
  
\## Guidelines  
\- Strictly separate user-facing changes from backend changes  
\- If unsure whether something is user-facing, ask: "Can the user see or interact with this in the app?" If no, it goes in Behind the scenes  
\- Group related commits into logical features  
\- Translate technical language into user-friendly terms  
\- Remove technical implementation details like file paths, function names, etc.  
\- Focus on what changed and why it matters to users  
\- Use clear, concise language  
\- Present information in order of importance  
\- Use consistent formatting throughout  
\- Use sentence case for all headings, titles, and content  
\- Keep feature headings short, clear, and user-focused  
  
\## Example of appropriate feature headings  
  
Keep feature headings short, direct, and user-focused:  
  
\- "Analytics dashboard"  
\- "HubSpot sync"  
\- "Contact import wizard"  
\- "Data export"  
\- "Email templates"  
\- "Contact management"  
\- "Campaign builder"  
\- "Sales pipeline view"  
  
AVOID backend-focused headings like:  
\- "Campaign API endpoints" ❌  
\- "Database optimization" ❌  
\- "Webhook configuration" ❌  
\- "AI model upgrade" ❌  
\- "Server infrastructure" ❌  
\- "Authentication middleware" ❌

\## Real changelog examples (properly ordered)  
  
\### Example 1: In-app notifications  
  
\`\`\`markdown  
\## New features  
  
\### In-app notifications  
  
Today, we're announcing the release of in-app notifications. On the bottom left corner of the app, you'll now see a bell icon that will show you notifications about your campaigns, billing, and any other important updates. We continue to send notifications in Slack Connect channels and via changelogs to subscribers via email, but we hope that in-app notifications will make it easier for you to stay up-to-date with what's happening in your account and what warrants your attention.  
  
You can manage your notifications settings by heading to Settings -> Notifications, where you can choose which notifications you'd like to receive -- Campaigns, Changelog, Marketing, and Account (required).  
  
\## Improvements  
  
\- Added the ability to search for companies by domain when creating a new prospecting audience  
\- Improved the user interface of the floating action bar for editing previously provided instructions  
\- Enhanced the Settings -> Mailboxes interface by displaying which campaign each mailbox is connected to  
  
\## Fixes  
  
\- Fixed an issue where contacts mentioned in out-of-office replies were not being properly added to outreach campaigns  
\- Fixed an issue where out-of-office replies were incorrectly triggering manual review actions  
\- Fixed an issue where contacts imported via CSV were not updating properly after manual qualification status changes  
\- Fixed an issue where the last email was not being forwarded to team members when manually archiving contacts  
\- Fixed an issue where the system was creating manual actions instead of sending emails for positive replies  
  
\## Behind the scenes  
  
\- Added a Fulfillment Policy to our website that outlines cancellation and refund procedures  
\- Fixed an issue where processing multiple integration rows simultaneously created duplicate contacts  
\- Updated the campaign creation API response to include a request ID for better tracking  
\- Added functionality to extract and determine names from email addresses during sequence generation  
\- Improved system performance by prefetching conversation histories for contacts with open todos  
\- Improved email generation by matching the sender's style when they don't use standard greetings in their messages  
\`\`\`  
  
\### Example 2: Overwrite qualifications  
  
\`\`\`markdown  
\## New features  
  
\### Overwrite qualifications  
  
In June, we launched Qualification, a new feature that uses LLMs to help you find relevant leads that match your ICP. Today, we're excited to announce that we've added the ability to overwrite qualifications. This feature allows you to manually change the qualification status of a contact, which can be useful if you want to manually qualify or disqualify a contact based on additional information you have.  
  
To overwrite a qualification, head to a campaign and click on "Qualification", and then "Preview" to see the qualification status of each contact. You can then click on the qualification status to change it to "Qualified" or "Disqualified". Next week, we'll be adding in-app notifications to let you know when a campaign has qualified contacts ready for your review.  
  
\## Improvements  
  
\- Added a message indicating that users can return later when generating responses that may take a while to complete  
\- Added a notification system to alert users when their included AI credits are about to be depleted  
\- Moved urgent notifications from the navbar to the bottom left corner of the screen for better visibility  
\- Removed the domain purchase functionality as part of our plan to sunset certain deliverability features  
\- Renamed the approval buttons to be more specific: "Approve reply" for single replies and "Approve sequence" for full sequences  
\- Renamed "CTA link" to "link" in click tracking and added URL visibility in the tooltip for better clarity  
\- We now display custom data in the context panel when previewing an integration audience for better insight  
\- We now show the email subject line when it differs from the previous email's subject in a thread for improved context  
  
\## Fixes  
  
\- Fixed a bug where users were seeing an incorrect "You don't have the required permissions" message when opening the application  
\- Fixed a bug where modifying Autopilot settings did not properly display the popup to mark existing todos as complete  
\- Fixed a bug where the mailbox selection in campaign creation was limited to only showing the first 25 mailboxes in the "From" dropdown  
  
\## Behind the scenes  
  
\- Added support for testing transformer functions while creating integration audiences to validate their behavior  
\- Fixed a bug where Slack notifications were incorrectly being sent for Error classifications  
\- Fixed a bug where sequences were incorrectly marked as "won" when past calendar events existed with the same contact  
\- Fixed an authentication issue with the Zapier integration that prevented proper connection  
\- Updated the campaign win condition to only trigger when the specific call-to-action link is clicked, rather than any link in the email  
\`\`\`  
  
\### Example 3: Microsoft 365 integration  
  
\`\`\`markdown  
\## New features  
  
\### Microsoft 365 integration  
  
This week, we have added full support for Microsoft 365 (previously Office 365) mailboxes. Previously, only Google Workspace, Outlook, iCloud, and other IMAP-based email providers were supported. The Microsoft 365 integration includes support for Microsoft Exchange Web Services, Exchange (Graph), Exchange ActiveSync, and personal Outlook accounts. We have also improved the interface to make it easier to select your email provider when adding a new mailbox.  
  
\## Improvements

\- Updated signup requirements on the marketing website to only accept professional email addresses  
  
\## Behind the scenes  
  
\- Fixed an issue where click tracking was not working correctly for base64-encoded URLs in emails  
\- Fixed a bug where follow-up emails were not being deleted when removing all replies in a conversation  
\- Fixed email and calendar synchronization issues that occurred after deleting and re-adding mailboxes  
\- Enhanced contact enrichment by providing more detailed reasoning and comprehensive answers when available  
\- Improved the structure and salutations in AI-generated replies to better match the style of previous emails in conversations

\`\`\`  
  
\### Example 4: Multilingual support  
  
\`\`\`markdown  
\## New features  
  
\### Multilingual support (preview)  
  
We are excited to announce that FirstQuadrant campaigns now support multiple languages! This means you can create campaigns not only in English (US), but also English (UK), Dutch, French, German, Romanian, and Hindi, and our AI will not only send highly personalized sequences in the right language, but also understand and respond to contacts in their preferred language. We will also be adding support for additional languages in the future.  
  
Multilingual support is currently in feature preview; if you'd like to try it out, go to \*\*Settings\*\* -> \*\*Feature preview\*\* and enable "Multilingual support". Then, you will see a new language selector in Sequence when creating a new campaign.  
  
\## Improvements  
  
\- You can now exclude specific campaigns when creating a new audience, instead of having to exclude all campaigns at once  
\- We added the ability to request access to integrations that are currently in preview  
\- Contact qualification features are now available in preview mode  
\- The interface now displays previously added mailboxes in campaigns, even if they are currently disabled  
\- When duplicating a campaign, the Qualification settings can now be copied independently of the audience settings  
\- You now have granular control over HubSpot contact syncing - choose to sync all contacts or only specific groups like those who are goaled or have replied  
  
\## Fixes  
  
\- We fixed a bug where campaigns were using mailboxes that weren't enabled for that specific campaign  
\- We resolved an issue where Qualification wasn't working properly when users hadn't added additional descriptions  
\- We fixed a bug that was causing Suppression lists to sometimes be hidden in the settings navigation  
  
\## Behind the scenes  
  
\- Our system now uses AI to intelligently determine whether to follow up with contacts based on their previous interactions, replacing the old rule-based system  
\- Campaign API keys are now properly updated when creating an Integrate-type audience  
\- We upgraded our systems to use GPT-4, which provides faster and more accurate responses compared to GPT-4 Turbo  
\- For improved analytics and tracking, referred contacts are now automatically added to their source campaigns  
\- In Integrate-type campaigns, we now process contacts in chronological order (oldest to newest) instead of randomly  
\`\`\`  
  
These examples demonstrate:  
1\. User-facing features only in the first three sections  
2\. All API, AI logic, database, and backend changes relegated to "Behind the scenes"  
3\. Clear separation between what users see vs technical infrastructure  
4\. Consistent sentence case throughout  
5\. User-friendly language that explains benefits  
6\. Marketing website changes go in the appropriate user-facing sections or Behind the scenes depending on their nature  
7\. Don't sound repetitive, rewrite sentence structure for each bullet for variety, with a consistent writing style
