I keep bumping into context limits, so this is right up my alley.\n\nThink YAML‑style indentation meets CSV‑like rows. Declare the schema once (users[3]{id,name,role}) and stream values without repeating keys. Minimal punctuation and very readable. My kind of minimalism.\n\nNice guardrails for models too. Explicit counts and field lists make outputs easier to validate. Benchmarks in the repo show big wins: 50 records goes 2,159 → 762 tokens (64.7%). Across examples, ~60.9% fewer with o200k_base. Your mileage will vary.\n\nFeels handy for tool calling, RAG, or any prompt with large arrays. There's a TypeScript package (@byjohann/toon) with a simple encode(json) entrypoint. Install via npm/pnpm/yarn and start saving tokens.\n\nRepo: https://github.com/johannschopplich/toon",

No API key, runs local via Ollama, and drops into a normal git flow.\n\nWhat I like: it only reads staged changes, filters lockfiles and binaries, proposes concise messages, and has an interactive loop that learns from your feedback. You can edit before committing, use draft mode, or stash the message for later when your brain has already moved on.\n\nThoughtful touches: a git alias so you can run \"git auto\", LazyGit integration, a timeline that summarizes your commit history, and 10 plus themes. Built with Cobra in Go and uses Ollama locally for speed and privacy. Piping works too: diny commit --print | git commit -F -\n\nIf you want consistent commits without context switching, diny is worth a look. Local LLM, fast CLI, smart diff parsing, easy installs with brew or scoop. Repo: https://github.com/dinoDanic/diny",

Arrays only append or refine the last item. Objects only add properties or refine the latest one. Partial JSON stays predictable, which keeps consumers calm.\n\nNice for long HTTP responses, server sent events, or LLM output. TypeScript, no deps, works with standard Streams like TextDecoderStream, and runs across runtimes.\n\nClean API too: for await (const v of parse(stream)) { ... }.\n\nLink if you want to try it: https://github.com/rictic/jsonriver",

TypeScript-first, accessible, extra variants, and lots of copy‑pasteable examples.\n\nWhat I like: Base UI under the hood gives you WAI‑ARIA, predictable focus, and solid performance. The multiple demos per component help you pick a pattern fast, so you ship instead of bikeshed. No more fighting focus rings at 2 am. @akash_3444 really cooked!\n\nStack check: React + TypeScript, Tailwind for styling, Base UI for primitives. Clean APIs and straightforward theming. I could drop this into a team rolling a design system next week.\n\nBuilding a library or a product? You get polished components, rich examples, and room to customize while leaning on MUI a11y: https://github.com/akash3444/basecn",

Then you smooth it, add dead zones and hysteresis, clamp extremes so your neck is happy, and calibrate a neutral pose every session.\n\nConstraints are real: 3 DoF only, limited update rate, yaw drift, device auto switching, and odd behavior when the buds lose fit.\n\nWinning here is mostly filter plus UX. Good neutral calibration, quick re center cues, and a tight latency budget across read, process, and render.\n\nThis is a fun direction for hands free play and accessibility: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ridepods-race-with-head/id6752268828",

About 25 MB, ~100 MB RAM, under 1% CPU on my machine (fans stay quiet). It auto cleans after 3 days and updates with Sparkle.\n\nThe AI pipeline is neat. In Gemini mode there are two calls: upload plus transcribe, then generate cards. Local mode with Ollama or LM Studio samples ~30 frames and makes 33+ calls to describe, merge, and title. Fully offline if you want. Bring your own API key.\n\nWhy I like it: a calm, honest log of how I actually worked, with distraction highlights now and a customizable dashboard and daily journal coming soon.

I bring Tailwind or CSS in JS, and Base UI handles behavior, keyboard support, and the accessibility semantics (yes, please). The TypeScript types make it hard to wire things wrong.\n\nThe team is a fun mashup: Radix a11y rigor, Floating UI positioning smarts, and MUI component craft. I get headless building blocks to compose buttons, menus, comboboxes, dialogs. No theme lock in.\n\nI would be surprised if this doesn't become the default over Radix on @shadcn UI once it reaches 1.0.\n\nIf you are shipping a product or a design system, this gives you a consistent behavior layer, sensible a11y defaults, and a clean React API. TypeScript, MIT license, and solid docs.\n\nCheck it out: https://github.com/mui/base-ui",

Thoughtful and practical.\n\nSetup is simple. Define a schema, new FilterQL({ schema }), then filter(data, query). Great for CLIs, dashboards, and APIs where users type filters. Fewer hand rolled predicates scattered around. Future me says thanks.\n\nSmall and focused with a clear language spec and a clean API.

No more forever secrets, about time!\n\nHighlights: Short lived tokens scoped to an installation. Granular permissions from your App. Works on GitHub hosted and self hosted runners. Great for cross repo and org automation without handing out PATs.\n\nHow it works: It uses the GitHub App flow. Create a JWT, exchange it for an installation access token, then the action exposes it to your steps. You add App credentials as secrets and rotate them when needed. Nothing long lived baked into the repo or runners.\n\nWhy I'm into it: Fewer long-lived secrets, tighter scopes, quick revoke and audit. TypeScript, ~138 stars, focused scope.\n\nIf you're modernizing CI security, this is an easy drop in (my security brain is happy): https://github.com/qoomon/actions--access-token",

    "excerpt": "Been thinking about moving more of my workflow to local-first tools this year, and @epicenter_so from YC S25 seems like it may hit the sweet spot for me. Press shortcut → speak → get text, and everything lands in one shared memory folder, plain text plus SQLite. You own the data, can use any model, and it is open source. Fast and simple.\n\nWhispering is the headliner: Desktop transcription that lives on your machine is great. Hit a hotkey, talk, get text. Bring your own API key, keep files local, and it runs on macOS, Windows, and Linux in a Tauri plus Rust shell. No web round trip.\n\nSince it is just text and SQLite, you can grep it, open it in Obsidian, or sync it however you like. No silos.\n\nWhy devs might enjoy this: unified open storage instead of app silos, model agnostic by design, and a modern stack with Svelte 5 and SvelteKit, TypeScript, Tauri and Rust, Tailwind, TanStack Query: https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter",

    "excerpt": "Been tinkering with avatar agents lately, and this project is pretty neat. StableAvatar is an end to end video diffusion transformer that makes infinite length audio driven avatar videos from a single reference image and audio - no post processing. The identity stays intact.\n\nThe clever bit is a time step-aware audio adapter. It modulates the denoiser at every diffusion step so the audio control stays stable across segments, which stops the usual drift you get when you pipe in off the shelf audio embeddings through cross attention.\n\nDuring inference, they add Audio Native Guidance to tighten lip sync and prosody. No face swap or face restore tricks here (FaceFusion, GFP GAN, CodeFormer).\n\nEnd result: long, stable, high quality, ID consistent renders for lectures, dubbing, and agents. And, open source!\n\nIf you are building realistic avatar or video agents, start here: https://github.com/Francis-Rings/StableAvatar",

    "excerpt": "I just read @josefprusa's piece on 3D printing hardware and the pipeline that turns cheap filings into chokepoints for open hardware: utility models, Paris priority, fast border actions.\n\nA patent can be weak and still wreck your supply chain. CN and DE utility models are fast and cheap with no real exam. You can file a bunch and see what sticks. You then get a 12 month Paris priority window to refile abroad. In the US, a Section 337 ITC case can block imports in roughly 16 to 18 months. That is faster than most challenges land, and open hardware feels that first.\n\nThe asymmetry on cost and time is the kicker. In China, a utility model filing is around ¥500. In Europe, oppositions run for years. In the US, an ex parte reexam starts around 6.3k to 12.6k dollars before counsel. An ITC exclusion order keeps biting until it is lifted. That chills open manufacturing.\n\nPolicy makes it worse. China's R and D super deduction sits around 200 percent in many cases. You do not need patents to claim it, but codifying R and D helps, so filings pile up. AM patents grew fast from 2013 to 2020, yet domestic utility models and local filings often do not show up in international family stats. The spike may be hiding in a different dataset.\n\nWhat we can do next: Use CERN OHL v2 with patent retaliation. Publish defensively at scale so prior art is easy to find. Build a hardware OIN or LOT style group with pooled defense and prior art bounties. And yes, use AI to help with search and drafting, with humans in the loop.\n\nLink: https://www.josefprusa.com/articles/open-hardware-in-3d-printing-is-dead/\n\nWho funds a hardware patent defense league that small shops can join? How do we standardize AI assisted defensive publishing across languages?  When we have AI patent clerks, can we make IP protection free, so open source maintainers can protect their good ideas like the big guys can?",
