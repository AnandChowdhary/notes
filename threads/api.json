    "excerpt": "Been tinkering with avatar agents lately, and this project is pretty neat. StableAvatar is an end to end video diffusion transformer that makes infinite length audio driven avatar videos from a single reference image and audio - no post processing. The identity stays intact.\n\nThe clever bit is a time step-aware audio adapter. It modulates the denoiser at every diffusion step so the audio control stays stable across segments, which stops the usual drift you get when you pipe in off the shelf audio embeddings through cross attention.\n\nDuring inference, they add Audio Native Guidance to tighten lip sync and prosody. No face swap or face restore tricks here (FaceFusion, GFP GAN, CodeFormer).\n\nEnd result: long, stable, high quality, ID consistent renders for lectures, dubbing, and agents. And, open source!\n\nIf you are building realistic avatar or video agents, start here: https://github.com/Francis-Rings/StableAvatar",

    "excerpt": "I just read @josefprusa's piece on 3D printing hardware and the pipeline that turns cheap filings into chokepoints for open hardware: utility models, Paris priority, fast border actions.\n\nA patent can be weak and still wreck your supply chain. CN and DE utility models are fast and cheap with no real exam. You can file a bunch and see what sticks. You then get a 12 month Paris priority window to refile abroad. In the US, a Section 337 ITC case can block imports in roughly 16 to 18 months. That is faster than most challenges land, and open hardware feels that first.\n\nThe asymmetry on cost and time is the kicker. In China, a utility model filing is around ¬•500. In Europe, oppositions run for years. In the US, an ex parte reexam starts around 6.3k to 12.6k dollars before counsel. An ITC exclusion order keeps biting until it is lifted. That chills open manufacturing.\n\nPolicy makes it worse. China's R and D super deduction sits around 200 percent in many cases. You do not need patents to claim it, but codifying R and D helps, so filings pile up. AM patents grew fast from 2013 to 2020, yet domestic utility models and local filings often do not show up in international family stats. The spike may be hiding in a different dataset.\n\nWhat we can do next: Use CERN OHL v2 with patent retaliation. Publish defensively at scale so prior art is easy to find. Build a hardware OIN or LOT style group with pooled defense and prior art bounties. And yes, use AI to help with search and drafting, with humans in the loop.\n\nLink: https://www.josefprusa.com/articles/open-hardware-in-3d-printing-is-dead/\n\nWho funds a hardware patent defense league that small shops can join? How do we standardize AI assisted defensive publishing across languages?  When we have AI patent clerks, can we make IP protection free, so open source maintainers can protect their good ideas like the big guys can?",
