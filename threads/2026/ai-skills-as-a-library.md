The new vercel-labs/agent-skills instantly clicked in my head with how I want to work with AI dev tools: not one giant agent that magically knows everything, but a bunch of focused, installable skills that map to real workflows. The React/Next.js part, react-best-practices, is especially nice. It is not vague "write better React" advice. It is 40+ specific rules, grouped and prioritized by impact, like "Eliminating waterfalls" and "Bundle size optimization" marked as critical. This is the kind of stuff you usually only remember after a slow Lighthouse run in production. web-design-guidelines feels like turning that one meticulous front-end engineer into a reusable skill. It checks accessibility, focus states, forms, typography quirks, dark mode, performance, i18n, and more. Basically a structured front-end review, but automated. I like it because it treats AI skills like a standard library for coding agents. Install once, reuse everywhere.
