MCP Apps is doing the "oh by the way, this is the new platform" thing. Again. Quick version: what used to be boring tool calling is turning into a real app platform. Tools can now ship sandboxed HTML UIs over an open, cross-vendor spec. And not theoretical open. Real open. As in Anthropic, OpenAI, VS Code, JetBrains, AWS, and friends are all speaking the same language. So instead of every LLM vendor inventing yet another proprietary plugin system with slightly different JSON and slightly more pain, you get: - One protocol (MCP) - One UI surface (HTML in a sandbox) - Many hosts (IDEs, terminals, clouds, chat UIs) Agents stop being closed gardens with bespoke extensions and start looking like browsers, with MCP as the HTTP of the agent world. We might look back at this moment as the point where LLM tools quietly turned into AI apps.
