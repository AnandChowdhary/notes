Meta buying Manus is about paying billions for the only agent stack that's actually winning in the real world if you think about it - Manus sits on top of the Remote Labor Index, where only about 2.5% of tasks are automated today. So this is not sci fi. It is "we are already replacing slices of real remote work, and there is a lot more headroom left." They are already at around $100M ARR. So Meta is not just acquiring a research toy. They are buying: - An orchestration layer that already runs real workflows for real companies - A workflow data layer that quietly captures how white collar work is actually done, step by step - A distribution engine for agents that are finally escaping the demo stage and touching live processes Meta is betting that the agent OS and workflow exhaust data are the new social graph. Everyone else is still polishing their chatbot UX. Meta just bought the back office.
