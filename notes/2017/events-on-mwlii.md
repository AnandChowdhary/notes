> One of my side longest-running projects is Made with Love in India (madewithloveinindia.org) where startups and businesses made in India embed a "Made with Love in India" badge in their footers and on products to be featured on that website. I thought it's a good idea to add community events on that website too, though I never got around to doing it.
