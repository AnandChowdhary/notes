AutoALT using AWS

> Back when I was working on Oswald Labs, I was in the accessibility space, and I noticed that many websites didn't have alt text for images. I thought we should use a cloud computer vision model to auto-generate alt tags and we added that as a feature called AutoALT. Today, major apps like Instagram do this by default.
