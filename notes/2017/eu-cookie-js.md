EU Cookie JS plugin, one yes for all websites, internationalisation

> I had this idea for a plugin that stores your EU cookie law preferences cross-website so you don't have to accept cookies everywhere, you could just say "Accept cookies on all websites" (that implement this unified plugin) and it would be well localized.
