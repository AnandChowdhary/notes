> One of my side longest-running projects is Made with Love in India (madewithloveinindia.org) where startups and businesses made in India embed a "Made with Love in India" badge in their footers and on products to be featured on that website. I thought it's a good idea to add a program where startups part of the program can get many benefits like cloud credits, which is a program now offered by many companies like Microsoft, Google, and Notion.
