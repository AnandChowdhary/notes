read aloud Arrow keys to navigate

> Back when I was working on Oswald Labs, we built a product that can chunk paragraphs into sentences smartly and highlight the right sentence during screen reader-style read aloud for accessibility, so listeners can follow more easily. This note is the idea that you should be able to use keyboard navigation (left-right keys) to seek between sentences like music in a playlist.
