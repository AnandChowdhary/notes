Amy for following up and introductions, personal assistant with invisible AI

Comment added in 2025:

> Amy (x.ai) was a personal assistant over email for scheduling. I thought it we should build one that works for two of the most common use cases for sales: automated follow-ups and intros, because that's where the money is. Today, Superhuman does that, and so does my startup FirstQuadrant.
