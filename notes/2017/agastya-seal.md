> Back when I was working on Oswald Labs, Agastya was our web accessibility plugin. The idea was that many websites used to have a "Validated by W3C" badge in the footer that was a symbol of pride that the HTML is valid. I figured similarly we could have a brand for a badge that shows that the website is also accessible.
