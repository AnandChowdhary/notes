[ ] Homework plays a critical, long-term role in a child’s development: understanding, achievement
[ ] Problem is students aren’t motivated; they study one night before the exam. Test fatigue, pressure
[ ] This can be solved by implementing an e-learning solution for daily practice; motivating, engaging
[ ] The problem is that previous research: no integration, distance learning; lab environment; no one stop research-backed solution
[ ] What we want to do is integrate what we know about e-learning with homework
[ ] In the first stage, literature research, surveys and interviews for finding relevant features to be in the platform
[ ] This will be followed by prototyping and lo-fi testing and then platform development
[ ] Show how individual features like gamification and notifications contribute separately and together using a factorial study design
[ ] show that platform contributes to better learning;
[ ] Take into consideration the pain points of teachers and use data analytics to help them make better classroom decisions
[ ] We want to partner with organizations like the Ministry of Education and OECD to conduct the research, build the platform, and implement it in the schools around the country
