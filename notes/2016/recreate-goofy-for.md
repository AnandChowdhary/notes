> Goofy was a macOS client for Facebook Messenger, back when Messenger didn't have a native app. I thought of the idea of similarly embedding other chat clients like WhatsApp and Skype in a unified app, the MVP being just iframe-ing the web clients into a multi-tabbed Swift app. Today, it exists as Texts.com and Beeper, both of which were acquired by Automattic.
