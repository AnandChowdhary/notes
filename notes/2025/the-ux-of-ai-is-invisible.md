The UX of AI is invisible. I've been thinking about why I'm not a fan of the chat interface as the primary mode of AI, and I think I have an answer. Voice helps, but the pattern is still you go to the AI to ask it something, and it responds to you. I actually think at @firstquadrant we have a unique insight - which is that AI runs based on external triggers. That is the key difference from assigning a Linear issue to Cursor Agents - it's proactive, not reactive. In our product, the AI agent runs when you receive a new email, calendar event update, add a note to a contact, something happens in a deal, an external trigger, etc., but the idea is that the agnet runs always and automatically in the background. The UX of AI is invisible.
