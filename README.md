## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About this repository

- [AnandChowdhary/notes-summary](https://github.com/AnandChowdhary/notes-summary) is used to generate the `README.md` summary
- Data before October 2020 was exported from Google Keep using [vHanda/google-keep-exporter](https://github.com/vHanda/google-keep-exporter)
- Older data was committed on the right date using [google-keep-notes.js](https://gist.github.com/AnandChowdhary/8cea4cdd63956e142e1794a2160ce7af)

### How to migrate notes

Create a `scripts/data.json` file with many notes (you can generate this using your favorite tool's data export functionality) with the following format. `slug` is optional but `date` and `content` are required:

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "note-title",
    "date": "2022-07-18",
    "content": "This is a note"
  }
]
```

Then `npm install` inside the `scripts` directory and run `node scripts/import-json.mjs`.
