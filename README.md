### How to migrate notes

Create a `scripts/data.json` file with many notes (you can generate this using your favorite tool's data export functionality) with the following format. `slug` is optional but `date` and `content` are required:

```json
[
  {
    "slug": "note-title",
    "date": "2022-07-18",
    "content": "This is a note"
  }
]
```

Then `npm install` inside the `scripts` directory and run `node scripts/import-json.mjs`.
